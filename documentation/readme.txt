IDarwinCore is an online database package which allows 
the display of a natural history collection's data
in a very organic way.  The data can be queried via 
a variety of fields such as genus/specifes/state/county/
collector/collection number/catalog number/accession number, etc.

This database package makes it easy to import data from a wide
variety of resources due to it's support of the DWC-A (Darwin
Core Archive) a standardized archive widely used by natural history
collectors world wide.

For more information about DWC-A format see
